## Introduction
WacomStylusDemoApp is a very simple drawing application. This sample code is meant to demonstrate how to use the WacomStylusFramework to receive Bluetooth Stylus data from an iPhone or iPad device.

## Application Details
The application uses the functions described in [Bluetooth Stylus Framework Reference](https://developer-docs.wacom.com/mobile-stylus/docs/bsf-reference) to communicate with the Wacom Stylus. Stylus data arrives as a WacomStylusEvent. If a stylus is not paired in the Wacom Stylus Demo App, you will still be able to draw with a finger.

You can download the sample code and view the inline comments to find out detailed information about the sample code itself.

The [Supported iPhone and iPad section](https://developer-docs.wacom.com/mobile-stylus/docs/bsf-basics#supported-iphone-ipads) of the Bluetooth Stylus Framework Basics page contains a list of supported Apple devices.
